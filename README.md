-All your design decisions
No many decisions were made, basically did the same thing I did for the main music app I did with SQL.
-Reasons behind each decision
Again, not many decisions were made while the code was being implemented. I used code from the main music app with SQL with minor changes made to connect to a MongoDB database.
-Which DB do you prefer, SQL or NoSQL?
I prefer NoSQL because we are not dealing with a lot of data. Seems a lot more clean and the code is a lot less.
-What went right?
Almost everything. Was getting an error stating "Failed to configure a DataSource" telling me if I want to embed a datasource etc. Added the h2 database dependency and it ran properly. 
-Challenges you faced
Only issue was connecting to the database. Had to troubleshoot.
-Which part you enjoyed working on the most?
Honestly, dealing with the database was easy and simple. A lot more clean than dealing with an SQL database.
